What & why is this?
-------------------
This repository hosts my thesis. It exists because version control is useful
when writing large documents. This README exists because I need to document the
process so future me doesn't shoot past me in the face.

How do I make a PDF from this mess?
-----------------------------------

Pre-requisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To compile this you will need:

* link:https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/[Ruby]
* link:https://rubygems.org/pages/download[RubyGems]
* link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf[Asciidoctor-pdf] (`gem install asciidoctor-pdf --pre`)

You'll also need to install `asciidoctor-mathematical` to render equations in
the PDF, which is not fun to install. It also is not possible to install it
under Microsoft Windows, from my understanding. You can avoid this headache by
not rendering the PDF and just rendering the HTML, which uses MathJAX to render
equations and is already bundeled with asciidoctor.

To install `asciidoctor-mathematical` on Debian/Ubuntu, first install the
dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get -qq -y install bison flex libffi-dev libxml2-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev ttf-lyx
```

Then install the gem:

```
gem install asciidoctor-mathematical
```

`asciidoctor-mathematical` annoyingly requires the `liblasm` library which you may
or may not have installed on your system. You'll know if you do if running
trying to build the document (_i.e._: running `sh build.sh` in the root folder)
results in the terminal yelling at you about not having `liblasm.so`. To install
it, you must download the library, compile/install it yourself, and finally move
it to the right folder. You can do that by following the instructions below that
I found https://github.com/akosma/eBook-Template[in a repo] by Adrian
Kosmaczewski:

```
wget http://ie.archive.ubuntu.com/gnome/sources/lasem/0.5/lasem-0.5.0.tar.xz
tar -xvf lasem-0.5.0.tar.xz
cd lasem-0.5.0
./configure
make
make install
sudo cp /usr/local/lib/liblasem-0.6.so /usr/lib/liblasem.so
```
You should be good to go then :D.

Building the PDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Presuming you've got the pre-reqs installed, the PDF can be built by running the
`build.sh` shell script. Just make sure the script has execution permissions.

```
chmod +x
./build.sh
```
