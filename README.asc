README

What & why is this?
-------------------
This repository hosts my thesis. It exists because version control is useful when writing large documents. This README exists because I need to document the process so future me doesn't shoot past me in the face.

How do I make a PDF from this mess?
-----------------------------------

Pre-requisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To compile this you will need:

* link:https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/[Ruby]
* link:https://rubygems.org/pages/download[RubyGems]
* link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf[Asciidoctor-pdf] (`gem install asciidoctor-pdf --pre`)

Building the PDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Presuming you've got the pre-reqs installed, the PDF can be built by running the `build.sh` shell script. Just make sure the script has execution permissions.

```
chmod +x
./build.sh
```
