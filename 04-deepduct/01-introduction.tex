\section{Introduction}

Histopathology is the study and practice of examining biological tissue at a microscopic level with the aim of detecting and/or analysing any disease that may happen to be manifesting therein. It is through the clinical histopathological analysis of tissue resulting from human mammary biopsies that all breast cancers are diagnosed.\par

Early breast lesions are associated with increased risk of invasive recurrence, and present important challenges for diagnosis by histopathology. Notably, in a consultation with clinical pathologists, a majority had cited distinguishing atypical ductal hyperplasias (ADH) from usual epithelial hyperplasias (UEH) and ductal carcinoma \textit{in situ} (DCIS) as the most common challenge among their breast biopsy consultations \citep{putti2005}.\par

Challenges like these can be mitigated in part by computationally assisted detection and diagnosis (CADe/CADx) software, which analyse medical images in a reproducible and quantitative manner with the aim of making the interpretation of these data by clinicians a less complex and subjective practice. While CADe software is sometimes used to aid in the screening of breast mammographies, challenges such as dimensional complexity has historically prevented the use of CADe/x to help interpret histological data \citep{rangayyan2007,madabhushi2009}.  \par

\subsection{Convolutional Neural Network Models for the Diagnosis of Breast Cancers}

At the heart of an increasing amount of modern CADe/x solutions are the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs or ConvNets) \citep{shin2016, cheng2016}. ConvNets are deep machine learning algorithms that use multiple weighted hidden layers of convolutional filters to make decisions about a given input. Recent developments in general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) have made ConvNets, whose use had historically been regarded as ``unrealistic'', practical many years after their first conception \citep{crick1989}. As a result, ConvNets have since been shown to be particularly well suited for the task of classifying and analysing images \citep{ciresan2011, ciresan2012}.\par

ConvNets have been successfully used to create very accurate models for the classification of breast cancer lesions. Binary models for classifying benign and malignant lesions, as well as multi-class models for distinguishing between multiple subtypes of breast lesions from H\&E stained biopsy slides have established with very high ($>90\%$) accuracy \citep{wei2017, han2017}. These models, however, are severely limited in that they classify whole imaging fields as belonging to a single class. These approaches entirely ignore the heterogeneous nature of breast lesions and are entirely ``black-boxes'' for clinicians, offering no added dimensions of information and little understanding as to why the model has interpreted a lesion the way it has. To mitigate this limitation, a classifier that could identify, classify and annotate sub-regions that exhibit characteristics of early lesions in medical images of breast biopsies. One such method to so is to generate localisation annotations with the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping algorithm. \par

\subsection{Localisation-Augmented Visualisation of Convolutional Neural Network Using Grad-CAM}

Recent work by \citeauthor{selvaraju2016} has made the interpretation of ConvNets much more clear by visually annotating inputs with general localisations of objects identified by the model. This technique, named Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), can produce heatmaps of areas within an input image that, according to a given ConvNet model, are likely to belong to a given class. Grad-CAM is generalisable to most ConvNet architectures, and does not require to be trained on example localisation annotations.\par

Grad-CAM has been since used for the dual purpose of localising classified regions and better understanding differences between classes in practical applications ranging from plant stress phenotyping to classifying colorectal polyps \citep{ghosal2017,korbar2017}.\par

In this work, we describe the DeepDuct model, a ConvNet model trained on histological images of breast biopsies classified across eight different lesion types, and combines it with the Grad-CAM algorithm to provide general localisation of the various lesions identified, while providing an opportunity to better understand the model.
