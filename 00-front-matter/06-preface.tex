%% NOTE
%% The preface needs to entirely revised. This is more of a place-holder than anything else. I might just not include an overview, but the idea was to unite the disperate chapters and with a theme and set the overall tone.

\subsection*{Overview}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Overview}
The harbinger of a far more lethal and difficult-to-treat disease, early breast cancer is a key, but often overlooked, point of study. Early breast cancers are often difficult to detect and classify, and the mode of progression between pre-invasive breast cancer lesions is not entirely understood.\par

Through the development of computational models for the regional detection and classification of early breast cancers, and by characterising the role of tight-junctions in their progression through traditional molecular biology; the projects herein offer novel insight into the fundamental nature of pre-invasive lesions of the mammary gland.\par
