This two-sided nature is expressed not only by their position (on the one hand they are connected in typical manner with the secreting epithelium, whereas on the other hand they interact with the stroma and the basal membrane in the same way as smooth muscle fibres), but also by their possession of potentialities of both kinds of tissue, although these potentialities become apparent only under pathological conditions of growth. This concept is the key-note of the following paper, whose purpose is to report a comparative study of the myoepithelia of various organs. Many phenomena that were detectable and detected in only one organ, will be used to elucidate certain otherwise obscure changes in other organs. First we shall examine the normal myoepithelia of various tissues (I), then consider regressive changes (II) and hyperplasia (III), in order to apply the information thus obtained to the problem of tumors (IV, V). To some extent, therefore, this paper constitutes a continuation of my paper from 1939 “On the myothelia of the mammary gland”. Additional material has been collected since then; unfortunately, however, some of the relevant documents were lost during the war and in the post-war period.}, booktitle={Current Topics in Pathology}, publisher={Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg}, author={Hamperl, H.}, year={1970}, pages={161–220}},

This slightly increased risk is generally not considered sufficiently high to justify (chemo)preventive therapy. It is therefore important to identify high-risk ductal hyperplastic lesions that would benefit from such a treatment. Nuclear morphometric features have been shown in previous work to be useful for objectively describing morphologic features associated with high risk in (pre)invasive breast lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether such morphometric features can also predict subsequent invasive cancer development in patients with the common pattern of usual ductal hyperplasia or a normal breast biopsy. The present case-control study included 423 women with normal breast biopsies (n = 89) or biopsies containing usual ductal hyperplasia (n = 334). Of these 423 women, 132 developed invasive breast cancer during follow-up (mean 16.7 ± 7.0 years). On the original hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, nuclear morphometry was performed with a digitizing video overlay system, and mitotic and apoptotic indices were assessed. Patients with mean nuclear feature values for area, perimeter, diameter or longest axis above the 75th percentile had 1.6–1.7 times the breast cancer risk of women with mean nuclear feature values below this value. Pairwise combinations of these features yielded slightly higher cancer risks for the fourth quartile patients, with the highest risk (1.9) for patients with SD of nuclear area and perimeter values above the 75th percentile. The number of apoptotic or mitotic cells had no prognostic value for patients with apparently normal tissue or usual ductal hyperplasia. Our results give a first indication that normal breast tissue or usual ductal hyperplasia harbor nuclear morphologic changes that, when assessed by morphometry, may be used to predict breast cancer development. It is worthwhile studying this further in independent groups of patients with long-term follow-up. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}, number={5}, journal={International Journal of Cancer}, author={Mommers, Ellen C.M. and Page, David L. and Dupont, William D. and Schuyler, Peggy and Leonhart, Angelique M. and Baak, Jan P.A. and Meijer, Chris J.L.M. and Van Diest, Paul J.}, year={2001}, month={Sep}, pages={282–285}},

A third cell type has recently been characterized in normal breast tissue by double-immunofluorescence analysis to express cytokeratin 5 (Ck5) only. These cells were shown to represent progenitor or adult stem cells that give rise to the glandular and myoepithelial cell lineage. The double-labelling technique has been applied to characterize a spectrum of intraductal epithelial proliferations, namely benign usual ductal hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, and ductal carcinoma in situ, all of which are thought to represent the gradual steps of a sequence in the development of breast cancer. Immunofluorescence studies with specific antibodies against Ck5, Ck8/18/19, and smooth muscle actin were complemented by western blotting analysis of Ck5 and Ck8/18/19 expression in normal breast tissue and in proliferative lesions. Usual ductal hyperplasia appears to be a Ck5-positive committed stem (progenitor) cell lesion with the same differentiation potential as seen in the normal breast. This is in sharp contrast to atypical ductal hyperplasia/ductal carcinoma in situ, which display the differentiated glandular immunophenotype (Ck8/18/19-positive, but Ck5-negative). These data require the abandonment of the idea of an obligate biological continuum of intraductal proliferations from benign to malignant. This study provides evidence that cells undergoing malignant transformation tend to be fairly advanced in the glandular lineage of differentiation. The committed stem (progenitor) cell model may contribute to a better understanding of both benign proliferative breast disease and breast cancer development.

For several decades a major challenge to human breast cancer research has been the identification of the molecular alterations associated with the different stages of breast cancer progression. Until recently, progress in attaining this goal has been hampered by technical limitations associated with applying advanced molecular technologies to the microscopic preinvasive stages of breast tumorigenesis. Recent advances in comprehensive, high-throughput genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic technologies in combination with advanced microdissection and ex vivo isolation techniques have provided for a more complete understanding of the complex molecular genetic and molecular biological inter-relationships of the different stages of human breast cancer evolution. Here we review the molecular biological data suggesting that breast cancer develops and evolves along two distinct molecular genetic pathways. We also briefly review gene expression and epigenetic data that support the view of the tumour microenvironment as an important co-conspirator rather than a passive bystander during human breast tumorigenesis.

A radiology database containing 2189 breast CNB was reviewed for isolated FEA or FEA in combination with atypical pathology. 79 patients had FEA. There were 48/79 with isolated FEA and 31/79 concomitant FEA with ADH, ALH, or LCIS. 46 subsequent excisional biopsies of isolated FEA resulted: benign 38/46, ADH 5/46, LCIS 2/46, DCIS 1/46. Concomitant FEA + ADH/ALH/LCIS group resulted: benign 26/31, DCIS 3/31, DCIS and LCIS 1/31, tubular carcinoma 1/31. DCIS/invasive cancer on excision in the FEA + ADH group is 5/31 versus 1/46 for isolated FEA (p 0.0489).
Findings support literature suggesting isolated FEA has a low association with carcinoma. These patients may not require surgical excision, but instead have close surveillance. Based on the higher cancer incidence in FEA combined with ADH, ALH, LCIS, or residual microcalcifications, we still recommend surgical excision.
Summary
Breast flat epithelial atypia (FEA) often coexists with more aggressive pathology and surgical excision is currently recommended when diagnosed by core needle biopsy. Recent studies have suggested isolated FEA has a low association with carcinoma and these patients may warrant close surveillance. Isolated FEA has a low association with carcinoma in our series.

In a case control study of 141 patients with long follow-up, we compared the ability of five morphological classifications to predict recurrence after local excision. A significant correlation was not found between recurrence and growth pattern when a traditional classification based on architecture was used nor with necrosis when a scheme based principally on this feature was employed. A correlation was, however, found between recurrence and “differentiation” as defined by nuclear features and cell polarization in a classification recently formulated by the European Pathologists Working Group (EPWG), but this failed to reach statistical significance at the 5% level. A stronger and statistically significant correlation was found between nuclear grade as defined by the EPWG and recurrence when cell polarization was disregarded, using the classification currently employed by the UK National Health Service and European Commission-funded Breast Screening Programmes. This was attributable to a small number of recurring cases being downgraded as a consequence of exhibiting polarized cells. A significant correlation between histology and recurrence was also observed using the Van Nuys classification, which is based on nuclear grade and necrosis. Whether the tumor recurred as in situ or invasive carcinoma was unrelated to histological classification, as was the time course over which it occurred. These findings strongly support the use of nuclear grade to identify cases of DCIS at high risk of recurrence after local excision, but further work is necessary to determine whether nuclear grade or necrosis is more appropriate to subdivide the non-high-grade cases.}, number={9}, journal={Human Pathology}, author={Badve, Sunil and A’hern, Roger P and Ward, Ann M and Millis, Rosemary R and Pinder, Sarah E and Ellis, Ian O and Gusterson, Barry A and Sloane, John P}, year={1998}, month={Sep}, pages={915–923}},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their roles remain to be clarified. We demonstrate that PAR-3 knockdown in MDCK cells retards apical protein delivery to the plasma membrane, and eventually leads to mislocalized apical domain formation at intercellular regions in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional culture systems. The defects in PAR-3 knockdown cells are efficiently rescued by wild-type PAR-3, but not by a point mutant (S827/829A) that lacks the ability to interact with aPKC, indicating that formation of the PAR-3–aPKC–PAR-6 complex is essential for apical membrane development. This is in sharp contrast with tight junction maturation, which does not necessarily depend on the aPKC–PAR-3 interaction, and indicates that the two fundamental processes essential for epithelial polarity are differentially regulated by these polarity proteins. Importantly, highly depolarized cells accumulate aPKC and PAR-6, but not PAR-3, on apical protein-containing vacuoles, which become targeted to PAR-3-positive primordial cell-cell contact sites during the initial stage of the repolarization process. Therefore, formation of the PAR-3–aPKC–PAR-6 complex might be required for targeting of not only the aPKC–PAR-6 complex but also of apical protein carrier vesicles to primordial junction structures.}, number={10}, journal={Journal of Cell Science}, author={Horikoshi, Yosuke and Suzuki, Atsushi and Yamanaka, Tomoyuki and Sasaki, Kazunori and Mizuno, Keiko and Sawada, Hajime and Yonemura, Shigenobu and Ohno, Shigeo}, year={2009}, month={May}, pages={1595–1606}},

Pals1 binds Patj (Pals1-associated tight-junction protein), a multi-PDZ-domain protein that associates with many tight junction proteins. The Crb complex also binds the conserved Par3/Par6/atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) polarity cassette that restricts migration of basolateral proteins through phosphorylation.

A protein with all the characteristics for a Crumbs homologue has been identified from patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa group 12, but this protein (CRB1) is only expressed in retina and some parts of the brain, both in human and mouse. Here, we describe CRB3, another Crumbs homologue that is preferentially expressed in epithelial tissues and skeletal muscles in human. CRB3 shares the conserved cytoplasmic domain with other Crumbs but exhibits a very short extracellular domain without the EGF- and laminin A-like G repeats present in the other Crumbs. CRB3 is localized to the apical and subapical area of epithelial cells from the mouse and human intestine, suggesting that it could play a role in epithelial morphogenesis. Indeed, expression of CRB3 or of a chimera containing the extracellular domain of the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CRB3 led to a slower development of functional tight junctions in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. This phenotype relied on the presence of CRB3 four last amino acids (ERLI) that are involved in a direct interaction with Par6, a regulator of epithelial polarity and tight junction formation. Thus, CRB3, through its cytoplasmic domain and its interactors, plays a role in apical membrane morphogenesis and tight junction regulation.}, number={3}, journal={Molecular Biology of the Cell}, author={Lemmers, Céline and Michel, Didier and Lane-Guermonprez, Lydie and Delgrossi, Marie-Hélène and Médina, Emmanuelle and Arsanto, Jean-Pierre and Bivic, André Le}, year={2004}, month={Mar}, pages={1324–1333}},

A subset of Maguk proteins, such as mLin-2 and protein associated with Lin-7 (Pals)1, also contain two L27 domains: an L27C domain that binds mLin-7 and an L27N domain of unknown function. Here, we demonstrate that the L27N domain targets Pals1 to tight junctions by binding to a PDZ domain protein, Pals1-associated tight junction (PATJ) protein, via a unique Maguk recruitment domain. PATJ is a homologue of Drosophila Discs Lost, a protein that is crucial for epithelial polarity and that exists in a complex with the apical polarity determinant, Crumbs. PATJ and a human Crumbs homologue, CRB1, colocalize with Pals1 to tight junctions, and CRB1 interacts with PATJ albeit indirectly via binding the Pals1 PDZ domain. In agreement, we find that a Drosophila homologue of Pals1 participates in identical interactions with Drosophila Crumbs and Discs Lost.

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of CRB3A function is essential as this protein prevents the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which contributes to tumor progression. To investigate the functional impact of altered CRB3A expression in cancer cells, we expressed CRB3A in HeLa cells, which are devoid of endogenous CRB3A. While control HeLa cells display a patchy F-actin distribution, CRB3A-expressing cells form a circumferential actomyosin belt. This reorganization of the cytoskeleton is accompanied by a transition from an ameboid cell shape to an epithelial-cell-like morphology. In addition, CRB3A increases the cohesion of HeLa cells. To perform these functions, CRB3A recruits p114RhoGEF and its activator Ehm2 to the cell periphery using both functional motifs of its cytoplasmic tail and increases RhoA activation levels. ROCK1 and ROCK2 (ROCK1/2), which are critical effectors of RhoA, are also essential to modulate the cytoskeleton and cell shape downstream of CRB3A. Overall, our study highlights novel roles for CRB3A and deciphers the signaling pathway conferring to CRB3A the ability to fulfill these functions.

We have tested the basis of an overgrowth phenotype driven by the Drosophila protein Crumbs (Crb), which nucleates an apical membrane complex that functionally interacts with the Par6/Par3/aPKC and Scrib/Dlg/Lgl apicobasal polarity complexes. We find that Crb-driven growth is dependent upon the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) pathway and its transcriptional effector Yorkie (Yki). Expression of the Crb intracellular domain elevates Yki activity, and this correlates in tissues and cultured cells with loss of Expanded (Ex), an apically localized SWH component that inhibits Yki. Reciprocally, loss of crb elevates Ex levels, although this excess Ex does not concentrate to its normal location at apical junctions. The Ex-regulatory domain of Crb maps to the juxtamembrane FERM-binding motif (JM), a cytoskeletal interaction domain distinct from the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) through which Crb binds polarity factors. Expression of Crb-JM drives Yki activity and organ growth with little effect on tissue architecture, while Crb-PBM reciprocally produces tissue architectural defects without significant effect on Yki activity. These studies identify Crb as a novel SWH regulator via JM-dependent effects on Ex levels and localization and suggest that discrete domains within Crb may allow it to integrate junctional polarity signals with a conserved growth pathway.}, number={7}, journal={Current Biology}, author={Robinson, Brian S. and Huang, Juang and Hong, Yang and Moberg, Kenneth H.}, year={2010}, month={Apr}, pages={582–590}},

The Hippo pathway senses cell density information to control tissue growth by regulating the localization of the transcriptional regulators TAZ and YAP (TAZ/YAP). TAZ/YAP also regulate TGF-Beta-SMAD signaling, but whether this role is linked to cell density sensing is unknown. Here we demonstrate that TAZ/YAP dictate the localization of active SMAD complexes in response to cell density-mediated formation of polarity complexes. In high-density cell cultures, the Hippo pathway drives cytoplasmic localization of TAZ/YAP, which sequesters SMAD complexes, thereby suppressing TGF-beta signaling. We show that during mouse embryogenesis, this is reflected by differences in TAZ/YAP localization, which define regions of active SMAD2/3 complexes. Interfering with TAZ/YAP phosphorylation drives nuclear accumulation of TAZ/YAP and SMAD2/3. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Crumbs polarity complex interacts with TAZ/YAP, which relays cell density information by promoting TAZ/YAP phosphorylation, cytoplasmic retention, and suppressed TGF-Beta signaling. Accordingly, disruption of the Crumbs complex enhances TGF-Beta signaling and predisposes cells to TGF-beta-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions.}, number={6}, journal={Developmental Cell}, author={Varelas, Xaralabos and Samavarchi-Tehrani, Payman and Narimatsu, Masahiro and Weiss, Alexander and Cockburn, Katie and Larsen, Brett G. and Rossant, Janet and Wrana, Jeffrey L.}, year={2010}, month={Dec}, pages={831–844}},

Bazooka/Par-3 is scaffold for the complex and contains three PDZ domains in tandem. PDZ domains can act singly or synergistically to bind the C-termini of interacting proteins. Sequence comparisons among Drosophila Baz and its human and C. elegans Par-3 counterparts indicate a divergence of the peptide binding pocket of PDZ1 and greater conservation for the pockets of PDZ2 and PDZ3. However, it is unclear whether the domains from different species share peptide binding preferences, or if their tandem organization affects their peptide binding properties. To investigate these questions, we first used phage display screens to identify unique peptide binding profiles for each single PDZ domain of Baz. Comparisons with published phage display screens indicate that Baz and C. elegans PDZ2 bind to similar peptides, and that the peptide binding preferences of Baz PDZ3 are more similar to C. elegans versus human PDZ3. Next we quantified the peptide binding preferences of each Baz PDZ domain using single identified peptides in surface plasmon resonance assays. In these direct binding studies, each peptide had a binding preference for a single PDZ domain (although the peptide binding of PDZ2 was weakest and the least specific). PDZ1 and PDZ3 bound their peptides with dissociation constants in the nM range, whereas PDZ2-peptide binding was in the µM range. To test whether tandem PDZ domain organization affects peptide binding, we examined a fusion protein containing all three PDZ domains and their normal linker regions. The binding strengths of the PDZ-specific peptides to single PDZ domains and to the PDZ domain tandem were indistinguishable.

The three proteins interact with each other to form a ternary complex and thus mutually regulate their functionality and localization. Here, we investigated the biochemical nature of the aPKC–PAR-3 interaction in detail to clarify its functional importance in cell polarity. Results: The highly conserved 26 amino acid sequence 816–841, in PAR-3 was found to be necessary and sufficient for the tight association with aPKC. Among several conserved serine/threonine residues within the region, aPKC preferentially phosphorylates serine-827 in vitro, and this phosphorylation reduces the stability of the PAR-3–aPKC interaction. Several analyses using a phospho-serine 827 specific antibody have established that this phosphorylation by aPKC occurs in vivo. Over-expression of a point mutant of PAR-3 (S827A), which is predicted to form a stable complex with aPKC, causes defects in the cell-cell contact-induced cell polarization of epithelial MDCK cells, similarly to a dominant negative mutant of aPKC.

PAR (partitioning‐defective) proteins were identified in Caenorhabditis elegans as determinants of asymmetric cell division and polarized cell growth. Recently, vertebrate orthologues of two of these proteins, ASIP/PAR‐3 and PAR‐6, were found to form a signalling complex with the small GTPases Cdc42/Rac1 and with atypical protein kinase C (PKC). Here we show that ASIP/PAR‐3 associates with the tight‐junction‐associated protein junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) in vitro and in vivo. No binding was observed with claudin‐1, ‐4 or ‐5. In fibroblasts and CHO cells overexpressing JAM, endogenous ASIP is recruited to JAM at sites of cell–cell contact. Over expression of truncated JAM lacking the extracellular part disrupts ASIP/PAR‐3 localization at intercellular junctions and delays ASIP/PAR‐3 recruitment to newly formed cell junctions. During junction formation, JAM appears early in primordial forms of junctions. Our data suggest that the ASIP/PAR‐3–aPKC complex is tethered to tight junctions via its association with JAM, indicating a potential role for JAM in the generation of cell polarity in epithelial cells.}, number={14}, journal={The EMBO Journal}, author={Ebnet, Klaus and Suzuki, Atsushi and Horikoshi, Yosuke and Hirose, Tomonori and Brickwedde, Maria-Katharina Meyer zu and Ohno, Shigeo and Vestweber, Dietmar}, year={2001}, month={Jul}, pages={3738–3748}},

@article{xue2013, title={Loss of Par3 promotes breast cancer metastasis by compromising cell–cell cohesion}, volume={15}, ISSN={1465-7392}, DOI={10.1038/ncb2663}, abstractNote={The mechanisms by which tumour cells metastasize and the role that cell polarity proteins play in this process are not well understood. We report that partitioning defective protein 3 (Par3) is dysregulated in metastasis in human breast cancer, and is associated with a higher tumour grade and ErbB2-positive status. Downregulation of Par3 cooperated with ErbB2 to induce cell invasion and metastasis in vivo. Interestingly, the metastatic behaviour was not associated with an overt mesenchymal phenotype. However, loss of Par3 inhibited E-cadherin junction stability, disrupted membrane and actin dynamics at cell–cell junctions and decreased cell–cell cohesion in a manner dependent on the Tiam1/Rac–GTP pathway. Inhibition of this pathway restored E-cadherin junction stability and blocked invasive behaviour of cells lacking Par3, suggesting that loss of Par3 promotes metastatic behaviour of ErbB2-induced tumour epithelial cells by decreasing cell–cell cohesion.

Loss of epithelial organization is a hallmark of carcinomas, but whether polarity regulates tumor growth and metastasis is poorly understood. To address this issue, we depleted the Par3 polarity gene by RNAi in combination with oncogenic Notch or Ras61L expression in the murine mammary gland. Par3 silencing dramatically reduced tumor latency in both models and produced invasive and metastatic tumors that retained epithelial marker expression. Par3 depletion was associated with induction of MMP9, destruction of the extracellular matrix, and invasion, all mediated by atypical PKC-dependant JAK/Stat3 activation. Importantly, Par3 expression is significantly reduced in human breast cancers, which correlates with active aPKC and Stat3. These data identify Par3 as a regulator of signaling pathways relevant to invasive breast cancer.}, number={5}, journal={Cancer Cell}, author={McCaffrey, Luke Martin and Montalbano, JoAnne and Mihai, Constantina and Macara, Ian G.}, year={2012}, month={Nov}, pages={601–614}},

However, understanding of mammalian PKC signalling systems is complicated by the large number of family members. Significant progress has been made through studies based on comparative analysis, which have defined a number of regulatory elements in PKCs which confer specific location and activation signals to each isotype. Further studies on simple organisms have shown that PKC signalling paradigms are conserved through evolution from yeast to humans, underscoring the importance of this family in cellular signalling and giving novel insights into PKC function in complex mammalian systems.}, number={2}, journal={Biochemical Journal}, author={Mellor, Harry and Parker, Peter J.}, year={1998}, month={Jun}, pages={281–292}}

Image classification approaches have been developed to identify and classify glandular regions in digital images of prostate tissues; however their success has been limited by difficulties in cellular segmentation and tissue heterogeneity. We hypothesized that utilizing image pixels to generate intensity histograms of hematoxylin (H) and eosin (E) stains deconvoluted from H&E images numerically captures the architectural difference between glands and stroma. In addition, we postulated that joint histograms of local binary patterns and local variance (LBPxVAR) can be used as sensitive textural features to differentiate benign/normal tissue from cancer. Here we utilized a machine learning approach comprising of a support vector machine (SVM) followed by a random forest (RF) classifier to digitally stratify prostate tissue into ST, BN and PCa areas. Two pathologists manually annotated 210 images of low- and high-grade tumors from slides that were selected from 20 radical prostatectomies and digitized at high-resolution. The 210 images were split into the training (n=19) and test (n=191) sets. Local intensity histograms of H and E were used to train a SVM classifier to separate ST from epithelium (BN+PCa). The performance of SVM prediction was evaluated by measuring the accuracy of delineating epithelial areas. The Jaccard J=59.5 ± 14.6 and Rand Ri=62.0 ± 7.5 indices reported a significantly better prediction when compared to a reference method (Chen et al., Clinical Proteomics 2013, 10:18) based on the averaged values from the test set. To distinguish BN from PCa we trained a RF classifier with LBPxVAR and local intensity histograms and obtained separate performance values for BN and PCa: JBN=35.2 ± 24.9, OBN=49.6 ± 32, JPCa=49.5 ± 18.5, OPCa=72.7 ± 14.8 and Ri=60.6 ± 7.6 in the test set. Our pixel-based classification does not rely on the detection of lumens, which is prone to errors and has limitations in high-grade cancers and has the potential to aid in clinical studies in which the quantification of tumor content is necessary to prognosticate the course of the disease. The image data set with ground truth annotation is available for public use to stimulate further research in this area.}, journal={Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics: The Official Journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society}, author={Gertych, Arkadiusz and Ing, Nathan and Ma, Zhaoxuan and Fuchs, Thomas J. and Salman, Sadri and Mohanty, Sambit and Bhele, Sanica and Velásquez-Vacca, Adriana and Amin, Mahul B. and Knudsen, Beatrice S.}, year={2015}, month={Dec}, pages={197–208}}

Only winner neurons are trained. Several deep neural columns become experts on inputs preprocessed in different ways; their predictions are averaged. Graphics cards allow for fast training.

Viewing skill acquisition in this ways suggests how one can avoid the problem currently facing AI of how to train a network to make human-like generalizations. In training a network one must progress, as the human learner does, from rules and facts to wholistic responses.

Breast cancer multi-classification is to identify subordinate classes of breast cancer (Ductal carcinoma, Fibroadenoma, Lobular carcinoma, etc.). However, breast cancer multi-classification from histopathological images faces two main challenges from: (1) the great difficulties in breast cancer multi-classification methods contrasting with the classification of binary classes (benign and malignant), and (2) the subtle differences in multiple classes due to the broad variability of high-resolution image appearances, high coherency of cancerous cells, and extensive inhomogeneity of color distribution. Therefore, automated breast cancer multi-classification from histopathological images is of great clinical significance yet has never been explored. Existing works in literature only focus on the binary classification but do not support further breast cancer quantitative assessment. In this study, we propose a breast cancer multi-classification method using a newly proposed deep learning model. The structured deep learning model has achieved remarkable performance (average 93.2% accuracy) on a large-scale dataset, which demonstrates the strength of our method in providing an efficient tool for breast cancer multi-classification in clinical settings.}, number={1}, journal={Scientific Reports}, author={Han, Zhongyi and Wei, Benzheng and Zheng, Yuanjie and Yin, Yilong and Li, Kejian and Li, Shuo}, year={2017}, month={Jun}, pages={4172}}
