This two-sided nature is expressed not only by their position (on the one hand they are connected in typical manner with the secreting epithelium, whereas on the other hand they interact with the stroma and the basal membrane in the same way as smooth muscle fibres), but also by their possession of potentialities of both kinds of tissue, although these potentialities become apparent only under pathological conditions of growth. This concept is the key-note of the following paper, whose purpose is to report a comparative study of the myoepithelia of various organs. Many phenomena that were detectable and detected in only one organ, will be used to elucidate certain otherwise obscure changes in other organs. First we shall examine the normal myoepithelia of various tissues (I), then consider regressive changes (II) and hyperplasia (III), in order to apply the information thus obtained to the problem of tumors (IV, V). To some extent, therefore, this paper constitutes a continuation of my paper from 1939 “On the myothelia of the mammary gland”. Additional material has been collected since then; unfortunately, however, some of the relevant documents were lost during the war and in the post-war period.}, booktitle={Current Topics in Pathology}, publisher={Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg}, author={Hamperl, H.}, year={1970}, pages={161–220}},

This slightly increased risk is generally not considered sufficiently high to justify (chemo)preventive therapy. It is therefore important to identify high-risk ductal hyperplastic lesions that would benefit from such a treatment. Nuclear morphometric features have been shown in previous work to be useful for objectively describing morphologic features associated with high risk in (pre)invasive breast lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether such morphometric features can also predict subsequent invasive cancer development in patients with the common pattern of usual ductal hyperplasia or a normal breast biopsy. The present case-control study included 423 women with normal breast biopsies (n = 89) or biopsies containing usual ductal hyperplasia (n = 334). Of these 423 women, 132 developed invasive breast cancer during follow-up (mean 16.7 ± 7.0 years). On the original hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, nuclear morphometry was performed with a digitizing video overlay system, and mitotic and apoptotic indices were assessed. Patients with mean nuclear feature values for area, perimeter, diameter or longest axis above the 75th percentile had 1.6–1.7 times the breast cancer risk of women with mean nuclear feature values below this value. Pairwise combinations of these features yielded slightly higher cancer risks for the fourth quartile patients, with the highest risk (1.9) for patients with SD of nuclear area and perimeter values above the 75th percentile. The number of apoptotic or mitotic cells had no prognostic value for patients with apparently normal tissue or usual ductal hyperplasia. Our results give a first indication that normal breast tissue or usual ductal hyperplasia harbor nuclear morphologic changes that, when assessed by morphometry, may be used to predict breast cancer development. It is worthwhile studying this further in independent groups of patients with long-term follow-up. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}, number={5}, journal={International Journal of Cancer}, author={Mommers, Ellen C.M. and Page, David L. and Dupont, William D. and Schuyler, Peggy and Leonhart, Angelique M. and Baak, Jan P.A. and Meijer, Chris J.L.M. and Van Diest, Paul J.}, year={2001}, month={Sep}, pages={282–285}},

A third cell type has recently been characterized in normal breast tissue by double-immunofluorescence analysis to express cytokeratin 5 (Ck5) only. These cells were shown to represent progenitor or adult stem cells that give rise to the glandular and myoepithelial cell lineage. The double-labelling technique has been applied to characterize a spectrum of intraductal epithelial proliferations, namely benign usual ductal hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, and ductal carcinoma in situ, all of which are thought to represent the gradual steps of a sequence in the development of breast cancer. Immunofluorescence studies with specific antibodies against Ck5, Ck8/18/19, and smooth muscle actin were complemented by western blotting analysis of Ck5 and Ck8/18/19 expression in normal breast tissue and in proliferative lesions. Usual ductal hyperplasia appears to be a Ck5-positive committed stem (progenitor) cell lesion with the same differentiation potential as seen in the normal breast. This is in sharp contrast to atypical ductal hyperplasia/ductal carcinoma in situ, which display the differentiated glandular immunophenotype (Ck8/18/19-positive, but Ck5-negative). These data require the abandonment of the idea of an obligate biological continuum of intraductal proliferations from benign to malignant. This study provides evidence that cells undergoing malignant transformation tend to be fairly advanced in the glandular lineage of differentiation. The committed stem (progenitor) cell model may contribute to a better understanding of both benign proliferative breast disease and breast cancer development.

For several decades a major challenge to human breast cancer research has been the identification of the molecular alterations associated with the different stages of breast cancer progression. Until recently, progress in attaining this goal has been hampered by technical limitations associated with applying advanced molecular technologies to the microscopic preinvasive stages of breast tumorigenesis. Recent advances in comprehensive, high-throughput genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic technologies in combination with advanced microdissection and ex vivo isolation techniques have provided for a more complete understanding of the complex molecular genetic and molecular biological inter-relationships of the different stages of human breast cancer evolution. Here we review the molecular biological data suggesting that breast cancer develops and evolves along two distinct molecular genetic pathways. We also briefly review gene expression and epigenetic data that support the view of the tumour microenvironment as an important co-conspirator rather than a passive bystander during human breast tumorigenesis.

A radiology database containing 2189 breast CNB was reviewed for isolated FEA or FEA in combination with atypical pathology. 79 patients had FEA. There were 48/79 with isolated FEA and 31/79 concomitant FEA with ADH, ALH, or LCIS. 46 subsequent excisional biopsies of isolated FEA resulted: benign 38/46, ADH 5/46, LCIS 2/46, DCIS 1/46. Concomitant FEA + ADH/ALH/LCIS group resulted: benign 26/31, DCIS 3/31, DCIS and LCIS 1/31, tubular carcinoma 1/31. DCIS/invasive cancer on excision in the FEA + ADH group is 5/31 versus 1/46 for isolated FEA (p 0.0489).
Findings support literature suggesting isolated FEA has a low association with carcinoma. These patients may not require surgical excision, but instead have close surveillance. Based on the higher cancer incidence in FEA combined with ADH, ALH, LCIS, or residual microcalcifications, we still recommend surgical excision.
Summary
Breast flat epithelial atypia (FEA) often coexists with more aggressive pathology and surgical excision is currently recommended when diagnosed by core needle biopsy. Recent studies have suggested isolated FEA has a low association with carcinoma and these patients may warrant close surveillance. Isolated FEA has a low association with carcinoma in our series.

In a case control study of 141 patients with long follow-up, we compared the ability of five morphological classifications to predict recurrence after local excision. A significant correlation was not found between recurrence and growth pattern when a traditional classification based on architecture was used nor with necrosis when a scheme based principally on this feature was employed. A correlation was, however, found between recurrence and “differentiation” as defined by nuclear features and cell polarization in a classification recently formulated by the European Pathologists Working Group (EPWG), but this failed to reach statistical significance at the 5% level. A stronger and statistically significant correlation was found between nuclear grade as defined by the EPWG and recurrence when cell polarization was disregarded, using the classification currently employed by the UK National Health Service and European Commission-funded Breast Screening Programmes. This was attributable to a small number of recurring cases being downgraded as a consequence of exhibiting polarized cells. A significant correlation between histology and recurrence was also observed using the Van Nuys classification, which is based on nuclear grade and necrosis. Whether the tumor recurred as in situ or invasive carcinoma was unrelated to histological classification, as was the time course over which it occurred. These findings strongly support the use of nuclear grade to identify cases of DCIS at high risk of recurrence after local excision, but further work is necessary to determine whether nuclear grade or necrosis is more appropriate to subdivide the non-high-grade cases.}, number={9}, journal={Human Pathology}, author={Badve, Sunil and A’hern, Roger P and Ward, Ann M and Millis, Rosemary R and Pinder, Sarah E and Ellis, Ian O and Gusterson, Barry A and Sloane, John P}, year={1998}, month={Sep}, pages={915–923}},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their roles remain to be clarified. We demonstrate that PAR-3 knockdown in MDCK cells retards apical protein delivery to the plasma membrane, and eventually leads to mislocalized apical domain formation at intercellular regions in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional culture systems. The defects in PAR-3 knockdown cells are efficiently rescued by wild-type PAR-3, but not by a point mutant (S827/829A) that lacks the ability to interact with aPKC, indicating that formation of the PAR-3–aPKC–PAR-6 complex is essential for apical membrane development. This is in sharp contrast with tight junction maturation, which does not necessarily depend on the aPKC–PAR-3 interaction, and indicates that the two fundamental processes essential for epithelial polarity are differentially regulated by these polarity proteins. Importantly, highly depolarized cells accumulate aPKC and PAR-6, but not PAR-3, on apical protein-containing vacuoles, which become targeted to PAR-3-positive primordial cell-cell contact sites during the initial stage of the repolarization process. Therefore, formation of the PAR-3–aPKC–PAR-6 complex might be required for targeting of not only the aPKC–PAR-6 complex but also of apical protein carrier vesicles to primordial junction structures.}, number={10}, journal={Journal of Cell Science}, author={Horikoshi, Yosuke and Suzuki, Atsushi and Yamanaka, Tomoyuki and Sasaki, Kazunori and Mizuno, Keiko and Sawada, Hajime and Yonemura, Shigenobu and Ohno, Shigeo}, year={2009}, month={May}, pages={1595–1606}},

Pals1 binds Patj (Pals1-associated tight-junction protein), a multi-PDZ-domain protein that associates with many tight junction proteins. The Crb complex also binds the conserved Par3/Par6/atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) polarity cassette that restricts migration of basolateral proteins through phosphorylation.

A protein with all the characteristics for a Crumbs homologue has been identified from patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa group 12, but this protein (CRB1) is only expressed in retina and some parts of the brain, both in human and mouse. Here, we describe CRB3, another Crumbs homologue that is preferentially expressed in epithelial tissues and skeletal muscles in human. CRB3 shares the conserved cytoplasmic domain with other Crumbs but exhibits a very short extracellular domain without the EGF- and laminin A-like G repeats present in the other Crumbs. CRB3 is localized to the apical and subapical area of epithelial cells from the mouse and human intestine, suggesting that it could play a role in epithelial morphogenesis. Indeed, expression of CRB3 or of a chimera containing the extracellular domain of the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CRB3 led to a slower development of functional tight junctions in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. This phenotype relied on the presence of CRB3 four last amino acids (ERLI) that are involved in a direct interaction with Par6, a regulator of epithelial polarity and tight junction formation. Thus, CRB3, through its cytoplasmic domain and its interactors, plays a role in apical membrane morphogenesis and tight junction regulation.}, number={3}, journal={Molecular Biology of the Cell}, author={Lemmers, Céline and Michel, Didier and Lane-Guermonprez, Lydie and Delgrossi, Marie-Hélène and Médina, Emmanuelle and Arsanto, Jean-Pierre and Bivic, André Le}, year={2004}, month={Mar}, pages={1324–1333}},

A subset of Maguk proteins, such as mLin-2 and protein associated with Lin-7 (Pals)1, also contain two L27 domains: an L27C domain that binds mLin-7 and an L27N domain of unknown function. Here, we demonstrate that the L27N domain targets Pals1 to tight junctions by binding to a PDZ domain protein, Pals1-associated tight junction (PATJ) protein, via a unique Maguk recruitment domain. PATJ is a homologue of Drosophila Discs Lost, a protein that is crucial for epithelial polarity and that exists in a complex with the apical polarity determinant, Crumbs. PATJ and a human Crumbs homologue, CRB1, colocalize with Pals1 to tight junctions, and CRB1 interacts with PATJ albeit indirectly via binding the Pals1 PDZ domain. In agreement, we find that a Drosophila homologue of Pals1 participates in identical interactions with Drosophila Crumbs and Discs Lost.

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of CRB3A function is essential as this protein prevents the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which contributes to tumor progression. To investigate the functional impact of altered CRB3A expression in cancer cells, we expressed CRB3A in HeLa cells, which are devoid of endogenous CRB3A. While control HeLa cells display a patchy F-actin distribution, CRB3A-expressing cells form a circumferential actomyosin belt. This reorganization of the cytoskeleton is accompanied by a transition from an ameboid cell shape to an epithelial-cell-like morphology. In addition, CRB3A increases the cohesion of HeLa cells. To perform these functions, CRB3A recruits p114RhoGEF and its activator Ehm2 to the cell periphery using both functional motifs of its cytoplasmic tail and increases RhoA activation levels. ROCK1 and ROCK2 (ROCK1/2), which are critical effectors of RhoA, are also essential to modulate the cytoskeleton and cell shape downstream of CRB3A. Overall, our study highlights novel roles for CRB3A and deciphers the signaling pathway conferring to CRB3A the ability to fulfill these functions.

We have tested the basis of an overgrowth phenotype driven by the Drosophila protein Crumbs (Crb), which nucleates an apical membrane complex that functionally interacts with the Par6/Par3/aPKC and Scrib/Dlg/Lgl apicobasal polarity complexes. We find that Crb-driven growth is dependent upon the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) pathway and its transcriptional effector Yorkie (Yki). Expression of the Crb intracellular domain elevates Yki activity, and this correlates in tissues and cultured cells with loss of Expanded (Ex), an apically localized SWH component that inhibits Yki. Reciprocally, loss of crb elevates Ex levels, although this excess Ex does not concentrate to its normal location at apical junctions. The Ex-regulatory domain of Crb maps to the juxtamembrane FERM-binding motif (JM), a cytoskeletal interaction domain distinct from the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) through which Crb binds polarity factors. Expression of Crb-JM drives Yki activity and organ growth with little effect on tissue architecture, while Crb-PBM reciprocally produces tissue architectural defects without significant effect on Yki activity. These studies identify Crb as a novel SWH regulator via JM-dependent effects on Ex levels and localization and suggest that discrete domains within Crb may allow it to integrate junctional polarity signals with a conserved growth pathway.}, number={7}, journal={Current Biology}, author={Robinson, Brian S. and Huang, Juang and Hong, Yang and Moberg, Kenneth H.}, year={2010}, month={Apr}, pages={582–590}},

The Hippo pathway senses cell density information to control tissue growth by regulating the localization of the transcriptional regulators TAZ and YAP (TAZ/YAP). TAZ/YAP also regulate TGF-Beta-SMAD signaling, but whether this role is linked to cell density sensing is unknown. Here we demonstrate that TAZ/YAP dictate the localization of active SMAD complexes in response to cell density-mediated formation of polarity complexes. In high-density cell cultures, the Hippo pathway drives cytoplasmic localization of TAZ/YAP, which sequesters SMAD complexes, thereby suppressing TGF-beta signaling. We show that during mouse embryogenesis, this is reflected by differences in TAZ/YAP localization, which define regions of active SMAD2/3 complexes. Interfering with TAZ/YAP phosphorylation drives nuclear accumulation of TAZ/YAP and SMAD2/3. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Crumbs polarity complex interacts with TAZ/YAP, which relays cell density information by promoting TAZ/YAP phosphorylation, cytoplasmic retention, and suppressed TGF-Beta signaling. Accordingly, disruption of the Crumbs complex enhances TGF-Beta signaling and predisposes cells to TGF-beta-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions.}, number={6}, journal={Developmental Cell}, author={Varelas, Xaralabos and Samavarchi-Tehrani, Payman and Narimatsu, Masahiro and Weiss, Alexander and Cockburn, Katie and Larsen, Brett G. and Rossant, Janet and Wrana, Jeffrey L.}, year={2010}, month={Dec}, pages={831–844}},

We show that Crb3 promotes the interaction between Yap and the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2 at apical cell junctions to induce Yap phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention, which drive cell differentiation.

Bazooka/Par-3 is scaffold for the complex and contains three PDZ domains in tandem. PDZ domains can act singly or synergistically to bind the C-termini of interacting proteins. Sequence comparisons among Drosophila Baz and its human and C. elegans Par-3 counterparts indicate a divergence of the peptide binding pocket of PDZ1 and greater conservation for the pockets of PDZ2 and PDZ3. However, it is unclear whether the domains from different species share peptide binding preferences, or if their tandem organization affects their peptide binding properties. To investigate these questions, we first used phage display screens to identify unique peptide binding profiles for each single PDZ domain of Baz. Comparisons with published phage display screens indicate that Baz and C. elegans PDZ2 bind to similar peptides, and that the peptide binding preferences of Baz PDZ3 are more similar to C. elegans versus human PDZ3. Next we quantified the peptide binding preferences of each Baz PDZ domain using single identified peptides in surface plasmon resonance assays. In these direct binding studies, each peptide had a binding preference for a single PDZ domain (although the peptide binding of PDZ2 was weakest and the least specific). PDZ1 and PDZ3 bound their peptides with dissociation constants in the nM range, whereas PDZ2-peptide binding was in the µM range. To test whether tandem PDZ domain organization affects peptide binding, we examined a fusion protein containing all three PDZ domains and their normal linker regions. The binding strengths of the PDZ-specific peptides to single PDZ domains and to the PDZ domain tandem were indistinguishable. Thus, the peptide binding pockets of each PDZ domain in Baz are not obviously affected by the presence of neighbouring PDZ domains, but act as isolated modules with specific in vitro peptide binding preferences.}, number={1}, journal={PLOS ONE}, author={Yu, Cao Guo and Tonikian, Raffi and Felsensteiner, Corinna and Jhingree, Jacquelyn R. and Desveaux, Darrell and Sidhu, Sachdev S. and Harris, Tony J.

The three proteins interact with each other to form a ternary complex and thus mutually regulate their functionality and localization. Here, we investigated the biochemical nature of the aPKC–PAR-3 interaction in detail to clarify its functional importance in cell polarity. Results: The highly conserved 26 amino acid sequence 816–841, in PAR-3 was found to be necessary and sufficient for the tight association with aPKC. Among several conserved serine/threonine residues within the region, aPKC preferentially phosphorylates serine-827 in vitro, and this phosphorylation reduces the stability of the PAR-3–aPKC interaction. Several analyses using a phospho-serine 827 specific antibody have established that this phosphorylation by aPKC occurs in vivo. Over-expression of a point mutant of PAR-3 (S827A), which is predicted to form a stable complex with aPKC, causes defects in the cell-cell contact-induced cell polarization of epithelial MDCK cells, similarly to a dominant negative mutant of aPKC.

We report that partitioning defective protein 3 (Par3) is dysregulated in metastasis in human breast cancer, and is associated with a higher tumour grade and ErbB2-positive status. Downregulation of Par3 cooperated with ErbB2 to induce cell invasion and metastasis in vivo. Interestingly, the metastatic behaviour was not associated with an overt mesenchymal phenotype. However, loss of Par3 inhibited E-cadherin junction stability, disrupted membrane and actin dynamics at cell–cell junctions and decreased cell–cell cohesion in a manner dependent on the Tiam1/Rac–GTP pathway. Inhibition of this pathway restored E-cadherin junction stability and blocked invasive behaviour of cells lacking Par3, suggesting that loss of Par3 promotes metastatic behaviour of ErbB2-induced tumour epithelial cells by decreasing cell–cell cohesion.

Loss of epithelial organization is a hallmark of carcinomas, but whether polarity regulates tumor growth and metastasis is poorly understood. To address this issue, we depleted the Par3 polarity gene by RNAi in combination with oncogenic Notch or Ras61L expression in the murine mammary gland. Par3 silencing dramatically reduced tumor latency in both models and produced invasive and metastatic tumors that retained epithelial marker expression. Par3 depletion was associated with induction of MMP9, destruction of the extracellular matrix, and invasion, all mediated by atypical PKC-dependant JAK/Stat3 activation. Importantly, Par3 expression is significantly reduced in human breast cancers, which correlates with active aPKC and Stat3. These data identify Par3 as a regulator of signaling pathways relevant to invasive breast cancer.}, number={5}, journal={Cancer Cell}, author={McCaffrey, Luke Martin and Montalbano, JoAnne and Mihai, Constantina and Macara, Ian G.}, year={2012}, month={Nov}, pages={601–614}},

Image classification approaches have been developed to identify and classify glandular regions in digital images of prostate tissues; however their success has been limited by difficulties in cellular segmentation and tissue heterogeneity. We hypothesized that utilizing image pixels to generate intensity histograms of hematoxylin (H) and eosin (E) stains deconvoluted from H&E images numerically captures the architectural difference between glands and stroma. In addition, we postulated that joint histograms of local binary patterns and local variance (LBPxVAR) can be used as sensitive textural features to differentiate benign/normal tissue from cancer. Here we utilized a machine learning approach comprising of a support vector machine (SVM) followed by a random forest (RF) classifier to digitally stratify prostate tissue into ST, BN and PCa areas. Two pathologists manually annotated 210 images of low- and high-grade tumors from slides that were selected from 20 radical prostatectomies and digitized at high-resolution. The 210 images were split into the training (n=19) and test (n=191) sets. Local intensity histograms of H and E were used to train a SVM classifier to separate ST from epithelium (BN+PCa). The performance of SVM prediction was evaluated by measuring the accuracy of delineating epithelial areas. The Jaccard J=59.5 ± 14.6 and Rand Ri=62.0 ± 7.5 indices reported a significantly better prediction when compared to a reference method (Chen et al., Clinical Proteomics 2013, 10:18) based on the averaged values from the test set. To distinguish BN from PCa we trained a RF classifier with LBPxVAR and local intensity histograms and obtained separate performance values for BN and PCa: JBN=35.2 ± 24.9, OBN=49.6 ± 32, JPCa=49.5 ± 18.5, OPCa=72.7 ± 14.8 and Ri=60.6 ± 7.6 in the test set. Our pixel-based classification does not rely on the detection of lumens, which is prone to errors and has limitations in high-grade cancers and has the potential to aid in clinical studies in which the quantification of tumor content is necessary to prognosticate the course of the disease.

Breast cancer multi-classification is to identify subordinate classes of breast cancer (Ductal carcinoma, Fibroadenoma, Lobular carcinoma, etc.). However, breast cancer multi-classification from histopathological images faces two main challenges from: (1) the great difficulties in breast cancer multi-classification methods contrasting with the classification of binary classes (benign and malignant), and (2) the subtle differences in multiple classes due to the broad variability of high-resolution image appearances, high coherency of cancerous cells, and extensive inhomogeneity of color distribution. Therefore, automated breast cancer multi-classification from histopathological images is of great clinical significance yet has never been explored. Existing works in literature only focus on the binary classification but do not support further breast cancer quantitative assessment. In this study, we propose a breast cancer multi-classification method using a newly proposed deep learning model. The structured deep learning model has achieved remarkable performance (average 93.2% accuracy) on a large-scale dataset, which demonstrates the strength of our method in providing an efficient tool for breast cancer multi-classification in clinical settings.}, number={1}, journal={Scientific Reports}, author={Han, Zhongyi and Wei, Benzheng and Zheng, Yuanjie and Yin, Yilong and Li, Kejian and Li, Shuo}, year={2017}, month={Jun}, pages={4172}}

Variation in transcriptional programs accounts for much of the biological diversity of human cells and tumours. In each cell, signal transduction and regulatory systems transduce information from the cell’s identity to its environmental status, thereby controlling the level of expression of every gene in the genome. Here we have characterized variation in gene expression patterns in a set of 65 surgical specimens of human breast tumours from 42 different individuals, using complementary DNA microarrays representing 8,102 human genes. These patterns provided a distinctive molecular portrait of each tumour. Twenty of the tumours were sampled twice, before and after a 16-week course of doxorubicin chemotherapy, and two tumours were paired with a lymph node metastasis from the same patient. Gene expression patterns in two tumour samples from the same individual were almost always more similar to each other than either was to any other sample.

	Molecular profiling has identified at least four subtypes of invasive breast carcinoma, which exhibit distinct clinical behaviour. There is good evidence now that DCIS represents the non-obligate precursor to invasive breast cancer and therefore it should be possible to identify similar molecular subtypes at this stage. In addition to a limited five-marker system to identify molecular subtypes in invasive breast cancer, it is evident that other biological molecules may identify distinct tumour subsets, though this has not been formally evaluated in DCIS.
	
	Methods:
	Tissue microarrays were constructed for 188 cases of DCIS. Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the expression patterns of oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Her2, EGFR, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, CK14, CK17, CK18, β4-integrin, β6-integrin, p53, SMA, maspin, Bcl-2, topoisomerase IIα and P-cadherin. Hierarchical clustering analysis was undertaken to identify any natural groupings, and the findings were validated in an independent sample series.
	
	Results:
	Each of the intrinsic molecular subtypes described for invasive breast cancer can be identified in DCIS, though there are differences in the relative frequency of subgroups, in particular, the triple negative and basal-like phenotype is very uncommon in DCIS. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified three main subtypes of DCIS determined largely by ER, PR, Her2 and Bcl-2, and this classification is related to conventional prognostic indicators. These subtypes were confirmed in an analysis on independent series of DCIS cases.
	
	Conclusion:
	This study indicates that DCIS may be classified in a similar manner to invasive breast cancer, and determining the relative frequency of different subtypes in DCIS and invasive disease may shed light on factors determining disease progression. It also demonstrates a role for Bcl-2 in classifying DCIS, which has recently been identified in invasive breast cancer.}, number={1}, journal={British Journal of Cancer}, author={Clark, S E and Warwick, J and Carpenter, R and Bowen, R L and Duffy, S W and Jones, J L}, year={2011}, month={Jan}, pages={120–127}}

Cases of breast cancer occurring in a cohort of women born between 1886 and 1928 with long-term follow-up were included in the study. Tissue microarrays were constructed from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 909 cases.

Kaplan–Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used in the analyses. During the first 5 years after diagnosis, there were significant differences in prognosis according to molecular subtypes with the best survival for the Luminal A subtype and the worst for HER2 and five negative phenotype. In this historic cohort of women with breast cancer, differences in breast cancer-specific survival according to subtype occur almost exclusively amongst the histopathological grade 2 tumours.

Luminal, basal-like, normal-like, and erbB2+ subgroups were identified and were shown to have different prognoses. The goal of this research was to determine if these different molecular subtypes of breast cancer also respond differently to preoperative chemotherapy.
 	Experimental Design: Fine needle aspirations of 82 breast cancers were obtained before starting preoperative paclitaxel followed by 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. Gene expression profiling was done with Affymetrix U133A microarrays and the previously reported “breast intrinsic” gene set was used for hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling to assign molecular class.
 	Results: The basal-like and erbB2+ subgroups were associated with the highest rates of pathologic complete response (CR), 45% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 24-68] and 45% (95% CI, 23-68), respectively, whereas the luminal tumors had a pathologic CR rate of 6% (95% CI, 1-21). No pathologic CR was observed among the normal-like cancers (95% CI, 0-31). Molecular class was not independent of conventional cliniocopathologic predictors of response such as estrogen receptor status and nuclear grade. None of the 61 genes associated with pathologic CR in the basal-like group were associated with pathologic CR in the erbB2+ group, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy sensitivity may vary between these two estrogen receptor–negative subtypes.

	At least four major categories of invasive breast cancer that are associated with different clinical outcomes have been identified by gene expression profiling: luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and basal-like. However, the prevalence of these phenotypes among cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has not been previously evaluated in detail. The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence of these distinct molecular subtypes among cases of DCIS and invasive breast cancer.
	
	Methods
	We constructed tissue microarrays (TMAs) from breast cancers that developed in 2897 women enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study (1976 to 1996). TMA slides were immunostained for oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Using these immunostain results, cases were grouped into molecularly defined subtypes.
	
	Results
	The prevalence of the distinct molecular phenotypes differed significantly between DCIS (n = 272) and invasive breast cancers (n = 2249). The luminal A phenotype was significantly more frequent among invasive cancers (73.4%) than among DCIS lesions (62.5%) (p = 0.0002). In contrast, luminal B and HER2 molecular phenotypes were both more frequent among DCIS (13.2% and 13.6%, respectively) as compared with invasive tumours (5.2% and 5.7%, respectively) (p < 0.0001). The basal-like phenotype was more frequent among the invasive cancers (10.9%) than DCIS (7.7%), although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.15). High-grade DCIS and invasive tumours were more likely to be HER2 type and basal-like than low- or intermediate-grade lesions. Among invasive tumours, basal-like and HER2 type tumours were more likely to be more than 2 cm in size, high-grade and have nodal involvement compared with luminal A tumours.
	
	Conclusion
	The major molecular phenotypes previously identified among invasive breast cancers were also identified among cases of DCIS.

Attention to this disease, public awareness, and advances in breast imaging have made a positive impact on breast cancer screening and detection. The growing use of image-detected biopsies has led to increased diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ and high-risk proliferative breast lesions. This progress, however, has created a challenge for pathologists. In lieu of the fact that these entities are difficult to diagnose even in tissue sections taken from surgically excised lesions, pathologist are now expected to diagnose them in small and often fragmented tissue/cellular samples obtained from image-guided biopsies. In addition, some proliferative lesions are associated with an increased risk of finding neighboring malignancy when diagnosed on minimally invasive procedures. Therefore, classifying these lesions in small biopsies is difficult and risky. Some of the most challenging areas in diagnostic pathology includes the differentiation between atypical ductal hyperplasia and low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular neoplasia versus solid low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, the correct interpretation of papillary lesions with atypia, and classifying the spectrum of columnar cell changes. Although these issues have been recognized for years, consensus criteria and uniform terminology for the diagnosis of these problematic lesions are far from being achieved. The purpose of this study is to review these “borderline” proliferative lesions in an effort to clarify some criteria and prompt the most needed discussion for consensus.}, number={3}, journal={Advances in Anatomic Pathology}, author={Masood, Shahla and Rosa, Marilin}, year={2011}, month={May}, pages={190–198}}

The development of carcinoma is associated with disrupted epithelial organization and solid ductal structures. The mechanisms underlying the morphological development of carcinoma are poorly understood, but it is thought that loss of cell polarity is an early event. Here we report the characterization of the development of human breast lesions leading to carcinoma. We identified a unique mechanism that generates solid ducts in carcinoma through progressive loss of polarity and collapse of the luminal architecture. This program initiates with asymmetric divisions of polarized cells that generate a stratified epithelium containing both polarized and depolarized cells. Stratified regions form cords that penetrate into the lumen, subdividing it into polarized secondary lumina. The secondary lumina then collapse with a concomitant decrease in RhoA and myosin II activity at the apical membrane and ultimately lose apical-basal polarity. By restoring RhoA activity in mice, ducts maintained lumen and cell polarity. Notably, disrupted tissue architecture through luminal collapse was reversible, and ducts with a lumen were re-established after oncogene suppression in vivo. This reveals a novel and common mechanism that contributes to carcinoma development by progressively disrupting cell and tissue organization.}, number={15}, journal={Genes \& Development}, author={Halaoui, Ruba and Rejon, Carlis and Chatterjee, Sudipa June and Szymborski, Joseph and Meterissian, Sarkis and Muller, William J. and Omeroglu, Atilla and McCaffrey, Luke}, year={2017}, month={Aug}, pages={1573–1587}}

Mammographic screening has been shown to be effective in reducing breast cancer mortality rates: screening programs have reduced mortality rates by 30–70%. Mammograms are difficult to interpret, especially in the screening context. The sensitivity of screening mammography is affected by image quality and the radiologist’s level of expertise. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology can improve the performance of radiologists, by increasing sensitivity to rates comparable to those obtained by double reading, in a cost-effective manner. Current research is directed toward the development of digital imaging and image analysis systems that can detect mammographic features, classify them, and provide visual prompts to the radiologist. Radiologists would like the ability to change the contrast of a mammogram, either manually or with pre-selected settings. Computer techniques for detecting, classifying, and annotating diagnostic features on the images would be desirable. This paper presents an overview of digital image processing and pattern analysis techniques to address several areas in CAD of breast cancer, including: contrast enhancement, detection and analysis of calcifications, detection and analysis of masses and tumors, analysis of bilateral asymmetry, and detection of architectural distortion. Although a few commercial CAD systems have been released, the detection of subtle signs of breast cancer such as global bilateral asymmetry and focal architectural distortion remains a difficult problem.

Here we consider one such real world example viz., accurate identification, classification and quantification of biotic and abiotic stresses in crop research and production. Up until now, this has been predominantly done manually by visual inspection and require specialized training. However, such techniques are hindered by subjectivity resulting from inter- and intra-rater cognitive variability. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a machine learning framework to identify and classify a diverse set of foliar stresses in the soybean plant with remarkable accuracy. We also present an explanation mechanism using gradient-weighted class activation mapping that isolates the visual symptoms used by the model to make predictions. This unsupervised identification of unique visual symptoms for each stress provides a quantitative measure of stress severity, allowing for identification, classification and quantification in one framework. The learnt model appears to be agnostic to species and make good predictions for other (non-soybean) species, demonstrating an ability of transfer learning.}, note={arXiv: 1710.08619}, journal={arXiv:1710.08619 [cs, stat]}, author={Ghosal, Sambuddha and Blystone, David and Singh, Asheesh K. and Ganapathysubramanian, Baskar and Singh, Arti and Sarkar, Soumik}, year={2017}, month={Oct}}

 @article{seaborn, title={seaborn: v0.5.0 (November 2014)}, DOI={10.5281/zenodo.12710}, abstractNote={This is a major release from 0.4. Highlights include new functions for plotting heatmaps, possibly while applying clustering algorithms to discover structured relationships. These functions are complemented by new custom colormap functions and a full set of IPython widgets that allow interactive selection of colormap parameters. The palette tutorial has been rewritten to cover these new tools and more generally provide guidance on how to use color in visualizations. There are also a number of smaller changes and bugfixes.
	
	
	Plotting functions
	
	
	Added the heatmap function for visualizing a matrix of data by
	color-encoding the values. See the docs for more
	information.
	Added the clustermap function for clustering and visualizing a
	matrix of data, with options to label individual rows and columns by
	colors. See the docs for more information. This work
	was lead by Olga Botvinnik.
	lmplot and pairplot get a new keyword argument, markers. This can
	be a single kind of marker or a list of different markers for each
	level of the hue variable. Using different markers for different
	hues should let plots be more comprehensible when reproduced to
	black-and-white (i.e. when printed). See the github pull
	request for examples.
	More generally, there is a new keyword argument in FacetGrid and
	PairGrid, hue_kws. This similarly lets plot aesthetics vary across
	the levels of the hue variable, but more flexibily. hue_kws should
	be a dictionary that maps the name of keyword arguments to lists of
	values that are as long as the number of levels of the hue variable.
	The argument subplot_kws has been added to FacetGrid. This
	allows for faceted plots with custom projections, including maps
	with
	Cartopy.
	
	
	
	Color palettes
	
	
	Added two new functions to create custom color palettes. For
	sequential palettes, you can use the light_palette function, which
	takes a seed color and creates a ramp from a very light, desaturated
	variant of it. For diverging palettes, you can use the
	diverging_palette function to create a balanced ramp between two
	endpoints to a light or dark midpoint. See the
	palette tutorial &lt;palette_tutorial&gt; for more information.
	Added the ability to specify the seed color for light_palette and
	dark_palette as a tuple of husl or hls space values or as a
	named xkcd color. The interpretation of the seed color is now
	provided by the new input parameter to these functions.
	Added several new interactive palette widgets:
	choose_colorbrewer_palette, choose_light_palette,
	choose_dark_palette, and choose_diverging_palette. For
	consistency, renamed the cubehelix widget to
	choose_cubehelix_palette (and fixed a bug where the cubehelix
	palette was reversed). These functions also now return either a
	color palette list or a matplotlib colormap when called, and that
	object will be live-updated as you play with the widget. This should
	make it easy to iterate over a plot until you find a good
	representation for the data. See the Github pull
	request or this
	notebook (download it to use the
	widgets) for more
	information.
	Overhauled the color palette tutorial to
	organize the discussion by class of color palette and provide more
	motivation behind the various choices one might make when choosing
	colors for their data.
	
	
	
	Bug fixes
	
	
	Fixed a bug in PairGrid that gave incorrect results (or a crash)
	when the input DataFrame has a non-default index.
	Fixed a bug in PairGrid where passing columns with a date-like
	datatype raised an exception.
	Fixed a bug where lmplot would show a legend when the hue variable
	was also used on either the rows or columns (making the legend
	redundant).
	Worked around a matplotlib bug that was forcing outliers in boxplot
	to appear as blue.
	kdeplot now accepts pandas Series for the data and data2
	arguments.
	Using a non-default correlation method in corrplot now implies
	sig_stars=False as the permutation test used to significance
	values for the correlations uses a pearson metric.
	Removed pdf.fonttype from the style definitions, as the value used
	in version 0.4 resulted in very large PDF files.}, publisher={ZENODO}, author={Waskom, Michael and Botvinnik, Olga and Hobson, Paul and Cole, John B. and Halchenko, Yaroslav and Hoyer, Stephan and Miles, Alistair and Augspurger, Tom and Yarkoni, Tal and Megies, Tobias and et al.}, year={2014}, month={Nov}}
