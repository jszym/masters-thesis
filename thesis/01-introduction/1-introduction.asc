== Introduction

////

Some concepts that need to be introduced:
    - Breast cancer stage: epidemiological descriptions & molecular
        - epidemiological: show/explain stats for different stages and
                            and explain how clinical is different accordingly
        - clinical: what are the known cell-biology differences, introduce some
                    ideas from Ruba's paper maybe.
        - Transition to cell polarity, it's definition and it's known
          functions in BrCa
    - Somehow describe get into describing machine-learning and it's
      emerging role in pathology
        - Define problem-space (problems w/ current pathology)
        - Define current solution-space (how ML is currently being used 
          for path'gy)
