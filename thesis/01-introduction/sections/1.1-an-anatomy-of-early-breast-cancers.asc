=== An Anatomy of Early Breast Cancers
Breast cancer is both a common and lethal diseases, having earned the dubious
distinction of being both the most common and second most fatal cancer amongst
females in Canada and around the world (<<ccs,Canadian Cancer Society 2015>>).
Breast cancer most commonly arises in the epithelium of the mammary gland's many
lactiferous ducts, which form a network that delivers to the nipple the milk
that is secreted by the lobules of the mammary gland; which is another origin
of breast carcinomas. The epithelium of the lactiferous duct is highly organised,
with well-defined tissue and cell polarity that is integral to the structure and
function of the duct. The tube-like lactiferous duct is a bilayered structure
comprised of the outer myoepithelial and inner epithelial monolayers,
both surrounding a hollow lumen at the duct's core. This epithelial inner-layer
is surrounded by an outer layer of myoepithelial cells which express
smooth-muscle actin (SMA) whose muscle-like contractile properties
biomechanically deliver milk along the duct in response to hormonal signal
(<<hamperl1970, Hamperl 1970>>).

==== Stages of Early Breast Cancer Progression
When diagnosing a suspected early breast cancer, pathologists analyse
needle-core biopsies with the aim of identifying and classifying any lesions
that may be present. Classification of lesions allow medical professionals to
better understand the nature of the particular disease, what treatment is most
appropriate, and what statistical outcomes are associated with the lesion.

The early stages of breast cancer manifest as pre-invasive,
hyper-proliferative lesions that exhibit progressive and gradual deterioration
of this epithelial organisation. Of these lesions, there are four histologically
 distinct classes: Usual Hyperplasia (UH), Flat Epithelial Atypia (FEA),
Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia (ADH) (or Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia (ALH) when
referring to the less common lobular lesion), and Ductal Carcinoma _In Situ_
(DCIS).

Ductal or lobular hyperplasias that do not present with abnormal tissue
architecture or dysplasia are classified as Usual Hyperplasia (UH), or
alternatively Proliferative Disease without Atypia (PDWA). These lesions confer
a relative risk of later developping breast cancer as high as 1.9, although this
increase in risk is not considered sufficient to warrant any profilactic measures,
including increased follow-up (<<mommers2001, Mommers _et al._ 2001>>). While
UH is traditionally believed to progress serialy through ADH, DCIS and ultimately
IDC due to early Loss of Homozygosity (LOH) analysis, more recent cytokeratin
immunophenotype and genetic hybridisation analysis has contested the evolutionary
relationship between UH and other proliferative breast lesions
(<<oconnell1994,O'Connell _et al._ 1994>>, <<boecker2002,Boecker _et al._ 2002>>).

ADH lesions are neoplasias of the lactiferous duct that exhibit subtle dysplasia
(as evidenced by nuclear hyperchromaticity), and can form micropapillary or
cribiform patterns (<<page1959, Page _et al._ 1959>>,
<<dion2016, Dion _et al._ 2016>>). Of the estimated one million instances of
benign breast cancer detected in the USA each  year, 10% are classified as ADH
(<<simpson2009, Simpson _et al._ 2009>>). While  these lesions have been
long-known and extensively proven to impart a low relative risk (approximately 4),
recent long-term follow-up studies have shown that one in eight individuals will
develop more advanced (local or invasive) breast cancers ten years after their
diagnosis. This proportion increases to 46% in individuals with more than one
atypical foci twenty-five years after diagnosis
(<<hartmann2015, Hartmann _et al._ 2015>>).

Arising in the terminal duct-lobule unit of the breast, FEA lesions are a
purported precursor to early low-grade ductal carcinomas, and in this regard are
 similar to ADH. Unlike ADH however, FEA lesions are far-more uncommon, never
present with complex architectural patterns (thus the indication "flat"), and
are characterised by multi-layered dilated ascini often made-up of columnar
cells (<<pinder2017, Pinder _et al._ 2017>>). While ADH is suspected to arise
from FEA lesions due their frequent coincidence, FEA is not independently
associated with a long-term increased risk of breast cancer, leaving the matter
unclear (<<bombonati2011,Bombonati & Sgroi 2011>>,
  <<lerwill2008, Lerwill _et al._ 2008>>, <<acott2016, Acott & Mancino 2016>>).

Benign early lesions go on to progress into localised malignant disease, which
in the lactiferous duct is termed ductal carcinoma _in situ_ (DCIS). DCIS is
classified as a Stage 0 cancer and accounts for 20% of all diagnosed breast
cancers in the USA in 2003; representing a 500% increase in occurrence over 20
years (<<bleicher2013,Bleicher 2013>>. <<kerlikowske2010,Kerlikowske 2010>>).

While DCIS has a relatively low average standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of
1.8, an estimated 30-50% of cases reoccur as invasive breast cancers
(<<narod2015,Narod _et al._ 2015>>, <<page1982,Page _et al._ 1982>>,
<<betsill1978,Betsill _et al._ 1978>>). When further stratified by how well
the lesion is differentiated, individuals with lesions classified as poorly
differentiated (using the European Pathologists Working Group guidelines) have
recurrence rates above 60% (<<badve1998,Badve _et al._ 1998>>). At this early
stage of cancer progression, the apical domain of the lumenal epithelium has
begun to shrink, resulting in abnormally small lumen (a phenotype referred to as
 "lumenal collapse" herein). Our understanding of the processes by which
transformed mammary duct epithelium undergoes lumenal collapse is still
developing, but recent studies have described a mechanism by which lumenal
tension is lost as myosin II and RhoA activity is greatly decreased at the
lumenal membrane of DCIS lesions (Halaoui _et al._ 2017, in review).

The lesion becomes an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC, or ILC in the lobular
instances) when epithelial cells breach the surrounding myoepithelial layer of
the duct and infiltrate into extra-cellular matrix (ECM). By this stage,
cellular polarity is entirely disrupted and the apical membrane domain has
completely disappeared.

Loss of cellular organisation and polarity is a common feature across epithelial
 cancers, but unlike some other cancers like those that present in the colon
where cell polarity is lost at late stages of the disease, breast cancer lesions
 lose their epithelial organisation early in their development
(<<hinck2014,Hinck & NÃ¤thke 2014>>).
