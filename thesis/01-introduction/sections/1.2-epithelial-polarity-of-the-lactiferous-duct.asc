When discussing the epithelial polarity of the lactiferous duct, one may be
referring to assymetric distribution at either the intercellular or
intracellular level.

At the macro, intercellular scale, ductal epithelia is said to exhibit tissue
polarity when cells organise into a monolayer forming a single lumen
(<<bissell2003,Bissell _et al._ 2003>>).

On the other hand, establisment of cellular apical-basolateral polarity is
achieved by the intracellular asymmetric distribution of proteins, phospholipids
, and carbohydrates within the inner epithelial monolayer of the mammary duct.
Two protein complexes, the Crumbs complex and the Par complex, are particularly
important determinants of the apical identity
(<<horikoshi2009,Horikoshi _et al_. 2009>>,
<<whiteman2014,Whiteman _et al_. 2014>>).

===== The Crumbs Complex
Localisation of the Crumbs complex to the plasma membrane both contributes to
the establishment and maintenance of its apical identity. The Crumbs complex
converges upon the apical transmembrane glycoprotein for which it is named,
Crumbs3 (_Crb3_), which serves as a scaffold for the complex. Crumbs3 directly
binds two proteins via its carboxy-terminal PDZ domain (`ERLI`): protein
associated with _Lin-7_ one (Pals1) and partitioning-defective protein six
(Par6) (<<lemmers2004,Lemmers _et al._ 2004>>, <<roh2003,Roh _et al._ 2003>>).
The presence of Pals1 also brings to the Crumbs complex the Pals1 associated
tight junction (PATJ) protein, which is essential for proper polarisation and
contributes to the establishment of tight-junctions in mammalian cells
(<<shin2005,Shin 2005>>).

// Insert Crb3 and TJs...

Crumbs3 has also been known to interact with FERM domain (so named for the amino
acid sequence of the domain) proteins through its PDZ domain. Crumbs3 also
interacts with the FERM-domain proteins EHM2 (also known as Lulu2) and YMO1,
homologues of _Drosophila melanogastor_ protein Yurt, which helps to establish
apical-basolateral polarity and maintain the size of the apical membrane by
regulating Crumbs3 (<<laprise2006,Laprise _et al._ 2006>>). Crumbs3 has also
been shown to recruit EHM2 and p114RhoGEF to maintain the actomyosin belt and
promote cell-cell adhesion in a cancer cell-lines, requiring both the C-terminal
FERM-binding and PDZ-binding motifs of Crumbs3 (<<loie2015,Loie _et al._ 2015>>).

The crumbs complex has been also shown to regulate important proliferative
programmes such as organ growth and mammary gland contact inhibition through the
Salvador/Warts/Hippo (hereafter Hippo) signalling pathway. Crumbs3 regulates the
Hippo pathway through interactions with, among other proteins, the FERM
domain-containing protein 6 (_FRMD6_), a mammalian homologue of the
_D. melanogastor_ gene _Ex_ (<<robinson2010,Robinson _et al._ 2010>>). Crumbs3
also regulates the Hippo pathway through direct interaction with WW-domain proteins.
One such instance is the direct interaction between the Hippo pathway co-effectors
yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), Tafazzin (TAZ), and Crumbs3; this occurs in
response to changes in cell density, which require changes to the cells
proliferative program (<<valeras2010,Valeras _et al._ 2010>>,
<<szymaniak2015,Szymaniak _et al._ 2015>>). In a similar, cell-density-sensing
manner, Crumbs3 interacts directly with Kibra's WW-domain to stabilise it,
preventing its degradation and promoting Hippo-pathway-mediated proliferation
(<<moleirinho2013,Moleirinho _et al._ 2013>>, <<mao2017,Mao _et al._ 2017>>).

Cell density is also coupled with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the Crumbs3-mediated inhibition
of SMAD; effectively reducing downstream activation Snail
(<<valeras2010,Valeras _et al._ 2010>>). In addition to being an important to the
EMT transcriptional programme, the zinc-finger protein Snail (_SNAI1_) is a potent
transcriptional inhibitor of Crumbs3 and to a lesser extent, PATJ and PALS1;
resulting in mislocalisation of the Crumbs and Par complexes and disruption of
tight-junction and polarity formation (<<wang2013,Wang _et al._ 2013>>,
<<whiteman2008,Whiteman _et al._ 2008>>).


===== The Par Complex
The Par complex is named after the eponymous family of proteins first
discovered in the 1980s as part of screen to identify maternal effect lethal
mutations in the model nematode _Caenorhabditis elegans_
(<<kemphues1988,Kemphues _et al._ 1988>>, <<goldstein2007,Goldstein & Macara 2007>>).
Of the six, the par proteins most relevant to apical membrane specification are
Par3 and Par6; both PDZ-domain scaffolding proteins and core members of the Par
complex (<<yu2014,Yu _et al._ 2014>>, <<hung1999,Hung & Kemphues 1999>>). Other
members of the Par complex include atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and the
cell division control protein 42 homologue (Cdc42) GTPase, binding to Par3
through Par6 which here acts as an adaptor (<<joberty2000, Joberty _et al._ 2000>>).
