Establisment of cellular apical-basolateral polarity is achieved by the intracellular asymmetric distribution of proteins, phospholipids, and carbohydrates within the inner epithelial monolayer of the mammary duct. Two protein complexes, the Crumbs complex and the Par complex, act as very important determinants of the apical identity (<<horikoshi2009, Horikoshi _et al_. 2009>>, <<whiteman2014, Whiteman _et al_. 2014>>). 

===== The Crumbs Complex
Localisation of the Crumbs complex to the plasma membrane both contributes to the establishment and maintenance of its apical identity. The Crumbs complex converges upon the apical transmembrane glycoprotein for which it is named, Crumbs3 (_Crb3_), which serves as a scaffold for the complex. Crumbs3 directly binds two proteins via its carboxy-terminal PDZ domain (`ERLI`): protein associated with _Lin-7_ one (Pals1) and partitioning-defective protein six (Par6) (<<lemmers2004,Lemmers _et al._ 2004>>, <<roh2003,Roh _et al._ 2003>>). The presence of Pals1 also brings to the Crumbs complex the Pals1 associated tight junction (PATJ) protein, which is essential for proper polarisation and contributes to the establishment of tight-junctions in mammalian cells (<<shin2005,Shin 2005>>).

Crumbs3 has also been known to interact with FERM domain (so named for the amino acid sequence of the domain) proteins through its PDZ domain. Crumbs3 also interacts with the FERM-domain proteins EHM2 (also known as Lulu2) and YMO1, homologues of _D. melanogastor_ protein Yurt, which helps to establish apical-basolateral polarity and maintain the size of the apical membrane by regulating Crumbs3 (<<laprise2006,Laprise _et al._ 2006>>). Crumbs3 has also been shown to recruit EHM2 and p114RhoGEF to maintain the actomyosin belt and promote cell-cell adhesion in a cancer cell-lines, requiring both the C-terminal FERM-binding and PDZ-binding motifs of Crumbs3 (<<loie2015,Loie _et al._ 2015>>).

Crumbs3 has been shown to regulate important proliferative programmes such as organ growth and mammary gland contact inhibition through the Hippo signalling pathway via interactions with the FERM domain-containing protein 6 (_FRMD6_), a mammalian homologue of the _D. melanogastor_ gene _Ex_ (<<robinson2010,Robinson _et al._ 2010>>, <<mao2017,Mao _et al._ 2017>>).
