=== An Anatomy of Early Breast Cancers

Breast cancer is both a common and lethal diseases, having earned the dubious distinction of being both the most common and second most fatal cancer amongst females in Canada and around the world (<<ccs,Canadian Cancer Society 2015>>). Breast cancer most commonly arises in the epithelium of the mammary gland's many lactiferous ducts, which form a network that delivers to the nipple the milk that is secreted by the lobules of the mammary gland; which is another origin of breast carcinomas. The tube-like lactiferous duct is a bilayered structure comprised of the outer myoepithelial and inner epithelial monolayers, both surrounding a hollow lumen at the duct's core. This epithelial inner-layer is surrounded by an outer layer of myoepithelial cells which express smooth-muscle actin (SMA) whose muscle-like contractile properties biomechanically deliver milk along the duct in response to hormonal signal (<<hamperl1970, Hamperl 1970>>).

==== Stages of Early Progression

The epithelium of the lactiferous duct is highly organised, with well-defined tissue and cell polarity that is integral to the structure and function of the duct. The early stages of breast cancer manifest as hyper-proliferative lesions that exhibit progressive and gradual deterioration of this epithelial organisation. There are two histologically distinct classes of early (i.e. pre-invasive) lesions: Flat Epithelial Atypia (FEA) and Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia (ADH) (or Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia (ALH) when referring to the less common lobular lesion). 

ADH lesions exhibit subtle dysplasia (as evidenced by nuclear hyperchromaticity), and can form micropapillary or cribiform patterns (<<page1959, Page _et al._ 1959>>, <<dion2016, Dion _et al._ 2016>>). Of the estimated one million instances of benign breast cancer detected in the USA each year, 10% are classified as ADH (<<simpson2009, Simpson _et al._ 2009>>). While these lesions have been long-known and extensively proven to impart a low relative risk (approximately 4), recent long-term follow-up studies have shown that one in eight individuals will develop more advanced (local or invasive) breast cancers ten years after their diagnosis. This proportion increases to 46% in individuals with more than one atypical foci twenty-five years after diagnosis (<<hartmann2015, Hartmann _et al._ 2015>>).

Arising in the terminal duct-lobule unit of the breast, FEA lesions are a purported precursor to early low-grade ductal carcinomas, and in this regard are similar to ADH. Unlike ADH however, FEA lesions are far-more uncommon, never present with complex architectural patterns (thus the indication "flat"), and are characterised by multi-layered dialated ascini often made-up of columnar cells (<<pinder2017, Pinder _et al._ 2017>>). While ADH is suspected to arise from FEA lesions due their frequent coincidence, FEA is not independently associated with a long-term increased risk of breast cancer, leaving the matter unclear (<<bombonati2011,Bombonati & Sgroi 2011>>, <<lerwill2008, Lerwill _et al._ 2008>>, <<acott2016, Acott & Mancino 2016>>).

Benign early lesions go on to progress into localised malignant disease, which in the lactiferous duct is termed ductal carcinoma _in situ_ (DCIS). DCIS is classified as a Stage 0 cancer and accounts for 20% of all diagnosed breast cancers in the USA in 2003; representing a 500% increase in occurence over 20 years (<<bleicher2013,Bleicher 2013>>. <<kerlikowske2010,Kerlikowske 2010>>).

While DCIS has a relatively low average standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.8, an estimated 30-50% of cases reoccur as invasive breast cancers (<<narod2015,Narod _et al._ 2015>>, <<page1982,Page _et al._ 1982>>, <<betsill1978,Betsill _et al._ 1978>>). When further stratified by how well the lesion is differentiated, indviduals with lesions classified as poorly differentiated (using the European Pathologists Working Group guidelines) have reoccurrence rates above 60% (<<badve1998,Badve _et al._ 1998>>). At this early stage of cancer progression, the apical domain of the lumenal epithelium has begun to shrink, resulting in abnormally small lumen (a phenotype reffered to as "luminal collapse" herein). Our understanding of the processes by which transformed mammary duct epithelium undergoes luminal collapse is still developing, but recent studies have described a mechanism by which ...

The lesion becomes an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC, or ILC in the lobular instances) when epithelial cells breach the surrounding myoepithelial layer of the duct and infiltrate into extra-cellular matrix (ECM). By this stage, cellular polarity is entirely disrupted and the apical membrane domain has completely disappeared.

Loss of cellular organisation and polarity is a common feature across epithelial cancers, but unlike some other cancers like those that present in the colon where cell polarity is lost at late stages of the disease, breast cancer lesions lose cell polarity early in their development (<<hinck2014,Hinck & NÃ¤thke 2014>>).

==== Epithelial Polarity of the Lactiferous Duct

Asymmetric distribution of polarity proteins, phospholipids, and carbohydrates within this inner epithelial layer result in the establishment of cellular apical-basolateral polarity. Two protein complexes, the Crumbs complex and the Par complex, act as very important determinants of the apical identity (<<horikoshi2009, Horikoshi _et al_. 2009>>, <<whiteman2014, Whiteman _et al_. 2014>>). 

Localisation of the Crumbs complex to the plasma membrane both contributes to the establishment and maintenance of its apical identity. The Crumbs complex converges upon the apical transmembrane glycoprotein for which it is named, Crumbs3 (_Crb3_), which serves as a scaffold for the complex. Crumbs3 directly binds two proteins via its carboxy terminal PDZ domain (`ERLI`): protein associated with _Lin-7_ one (Pals1) and partitioning-defective protein six (Par6) (<<lemmers2004,Lemmers _et al._ 2004>>, <<roh2003,Roh _et al._ 2003>>).
