=== An Anatomy of Early Breast Cancers

Breast cancer is both a common and lethal diseases, having earned the dubious distinction of being both the most common and second most fatal cancer amongst females in Canada and around the world (<<ccs,Canadian Cancer Society 2015>>). Breast cancer most commonly arises in the epithelium of the mammary gland's many lactiferous ducts, which form a network that delivers to the nipple the milk that is secreted by the lobules of the mammary gland; which is another origin of breast carcinomas. The tube-like lactiferous duct is a bilayered structure comprised of an outer myoepithelial and inner epithelial monolayers, both surrounding a hollow lumen at the duct's core. This epithelial inner-layer is surrounded by an outer layer of myoepithelial cells which express smooth-muscle actin (SMA) whose muscle-like contractile properties biomechanically deliver milk along the duct in response to hormonal signal (<<hamperl1970, Hamperl 1970>>).

The epithelium of the lactiferous duct is highly organised, with well-defined tissue and cell polarity that is integral to the structure and function of the duct. Asymmetric distribution of polarity proteins, phospholipids, and carbohydrates within this inner epithelial layer result in the establishment of cellular apical-basolateral polarity. 

Two protein complexes, the Crumbs complex and the Par complex, act as very important determinants of the apical identity (<<horikoshi2009, Horikoshi _et al_. 2009>>, <<whiteman2014, Whiteman _et al_. 2014>>). Localisation of the Crumbs complex to the plasma membrane both contributes to the establishment and maintenance of it's apical identity. The Crumbs complex converges upon the apical transmembrane glycoprotein for which it is named, Crumbs3 (_Crb3_), which serves as a scaffold for the complex. Crumbs3 directly binds two proteins via its carboxy terminal PDZ domain (`ERLI`): protein associated with _Lin-7_ one (Pals1) and partitioning-defective protein six (Par6) (<<lemmers2004,Lemmers _et al._ 2004>>, <<roh2003,Roh _et al._ 2003>>).

This apical-basolateral specification of plasma membranes is now understood to play a key role in manifold processes important to the development and morphogenic homeostatis of the duct, and the abrogation of cell-polarity (and therefore these processes) are  progression of cancer.
